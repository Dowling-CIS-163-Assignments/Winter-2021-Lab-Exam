	/****************************************************
	 *
	 * 
	 * Write a method that will determine whether each number in an
	 * array is a larger power of 2 than the previous number. For
	 * example, 8 (2^3) is a larger power of 2 than 4 (2^2) (i.e.,
	 * the power 3 is greater than the power 2). Any number that is
	 * not power of 2 results in false being returned, while any
	 * entry that contains any invalid characters (like letters) is
	 * ignored.
	 * 
	 * Examples:
	 * {"2", "4", "8", "16"}  -> true
	 * {"16", "8", "4", "2"}  -> false
	 * {"2", "4", "6", "8"} -> false
	 * {"2", "4", "6a", "8"} -> true
	 * {"zelda", "2", "mario", "samus", "32"} -> true
	 * {"1"} -> true
	 * {"0"} -> false
	 * {} -> true
